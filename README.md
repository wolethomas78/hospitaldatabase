## Executive Summary
### Despite the existence of effective and thorough healthcare systems that improve patient outcomes, there is always room for a more efficient Hospital Management System (HMS). This project aims to compile examples of previous initiatives, develop a comprehensive overview of the scope of work, and conduct a detailed analysis of the data used in hospital management systems. This overview will include various data models addressing the needs for appointment scheduling, hospital operations, and financial management.
