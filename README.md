# HMS_database
## Executive Summary
#### Despite the existence of effective and thorough healthcare systems that improve patient outcomes, there is always room for a more efficient Hospital Management System (HMS). This project aims to compile examples of previous initiatives, develop a comprehensive overview of the scope of work, and conduct a detailed analysis of the data used in hospital management systems. This overview will include various data models addressing the needs for appointment scheduling, hospital operations, and financial management.

#### This report begins with the logical design and modeling of our dataset. We start by developing an ER/EER diagram, along with the assumptions that underpin it, to visually depict the entities and their relationships. The next section transforms this logical diagram into a detailed database diagram, forming the relational schema. We then normalize the tables to ensure they meet the requirements of the third normal form (3NF). The report concludes with a concise summary of the design.

## Problem Description
#### The traditional Hospital Management System faces several difficulties, particularly with information retrieval. For instance, each patient's identification number must be unique, and this process is typically managed manually, resulting in transaction errors and making the management and security of patient information and diagnosis data both time-consuming and labor-intensive. This data model aims to enhance the hospital management system by simplifying the registration and maintenance of patient records, enabling staff to access and update information as necessary. Updates and changes can be made and stored in the databases simultaneously by administrators or receptionists.
