## Executive Summary
#### Despite the existence of effective and thorough healthcare systems that improve patient outcomes, there is always room for a more efficient Hospital Management System (HMS). This project aims to compile examples of previous initiatives, develop a comprehensive overview of the scope of work, and conduct a detailed analysis of the data used in hospital management systems. This overview will include various data models addressing the needs for appointment scheduling, hospital operations, and financial management.

#### This report begins with the logical design and modeling of our dataset. We start by developing an ER/EER diagram, along with the assumptions that underpin it, to visually depict the entities and their relationships. The next section transforms this logical diagram into a detailed database diagram, forming the relational schema. We then normalize the tables to ensure they meet the requirements of the third normal form (3NF). The report concludes with a concise summary of the design.
